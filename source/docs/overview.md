GeoOS is an open source Spatial computing library created by the Spatial-Go organization under Yijing Zhilian, focusing on more efficient geospatial computing.

GeoOS is developed using Golang, and currently supports hundreds of common geospatial calculation methods such as coordinate conversion, vector creation, spatial clustering, and graphics operations.

Based on the development of GEOOS, we strive to make spatial computing more efficient and make spatial intelligence more flexible and easy to use.
